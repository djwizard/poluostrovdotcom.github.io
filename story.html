            <p>Accidentally, two events happen at the same time in the Fall of 2015, one real and one fictional.</p>

                <p>A moment from "Back To The Future"</p>
              </div>

            <p>Fictional was: Marty McFly, a character from “Back To The Future”, traveled to the “future” of October 2015. Real was: 4 founders decided to form a company to build a real flying car.</p>
        
        
        
            <p>During one of the Science Fiction lectures, Jim Dukhovny talked about how flying cars are finally possible in 2015. But he lacked technical skills to take on such a complicated task by himself. So, in several weeks four friends met at a Coupa Cafe in Palo Alto: Dr. Constantine Kisly, Pavel Markin, Oleg Petrov, Jim Dukhovny - each a technical genius.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The first real flying car was drawn on a napkin in a cafe. It was assumed it would take about 6 months to build one. Boy, was this an underestimate.</p> 
            <p>The constraints were: it has to be a real car (driving in driving lanes, parking in parking spaces), it has to have a vertical takeoff (otherwise it is not a real flying car), it has to be affordable for most people (not just the rich).</p>

            <div class="cell-xs-12 cell-md-8 wow fadeInLeftSmall mt-3">            
            <p>In 2016, the first small arm-size prototype was built. Hard work in a garage and coffee shops, investing their own money into the company, finally led to great results.</p>

              </div>


            <p>After the rigorous software and hardware testing, including wind tunnel simulations and flow dynamics, a body of a real arm-size RV car was taken, and the proprietary propulsion was installed.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>This scaled version, together with a part of a real full-size propulsion was demoed to one of the most revolutionary and successful businessmen in history: Tim Draper.</p>
            <p>Tim Draper pointed out areas which need improvement to make it a market-ready car. Once those improvements were made Tim Draper became the pioneering investor of the company. Tim Draper also became a mentor and an inspiration to the team.</p>

            <p>The next big step was proving the efficient forward flight, in order for this flying car to become not a toy, but an everyday commute vehicle. After this was accomplished, a big round of investment sent the company on a full-time focused journey.</p>

            <p>In 2019, after 4 years of R&D, a full-size car was finally flown. Shortly after that it was made to fly autonomously for safer testing. A lot more improvements have been made and a first semi-public demo of a real full-size flying car was shown to a group of investors. It consisted of driving, vertical takeoff, and a small forward motion.</p>
